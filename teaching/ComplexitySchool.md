## Data Diggers: The Art of Interacting and Collecting Data from the Web
###  Summer 2024 Complexity Global School 

This course gets into the practical skills of web scraping and data interaction, empowering you to uncover, collect, and analyze web data effectively. Many people spend hours clicking, typing, and copy pasting to perform repetitive tasks, unaware that the machine theyâ€™re using could do their job in seconds if they gave it the right instructions. Through hands-on projects and real-world applications, we will learn how to navigate complex websites, extract valuable information, and understand the ethical considerations involved in data collection. This course is perfect for those who are interested in leveraging web data to drive decisions and advanced research.
