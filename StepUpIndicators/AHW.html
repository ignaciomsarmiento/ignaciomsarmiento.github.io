Inconsistency in the methods used may account for some of this variation as both inter- and intra- observer reliability has been found to improve when assessors used a half-point scale compared to the full-point scale, and following training. Body condition score assessment requires that animals are gathered and handled. However, the method is quick and simple and is already used on farm by many managers to monitor feed intake levels, thus there is good on-farm acceptability of this measure.</td>

Many farms do not keep records of lamb mortalities. However assessment of some measure of lamb productivity is possible with even rudimentary farm records, although these fail to distinguish between different causes of mortality. Improved record keeping would improve the reliability of this measure, as seen in other datasets. Lamb mortality can be affected by a number of other factors, including maternal disease state, maternal stress, stocking density, and resource, thus this indicator is not specific for absence of prolonged hunger. However, this lack of specificity can also mean that lamb mortality may function as an iceberg indicator for more than one welfare condition.</td>

In addition, dirty or contaminated water courses, whether natural or man-made, will also reduce palatability. Unless natural water sources are widely dispersed or hard to find, this measure can be readily determined in both indoor and outdoor managed sheep.</td>

The reliability of lying time as a measure of welfare has not been tested in sheep, although good reliability is reported in cows. Time spent lying increases with stage of gestation, decreases with re-grouping or mixing of sheep (36) or separation of ewes and lambs, and increases or decreases with disease [e.g., lameness ; sheep scab infestation]; therefore, this measure is not specific to the provision of a comfortable resting area.  With sufficient space in an indoor environment sheep lay for nearly 70% of an observation period, suggesting that assessing lying time may be feasible. However, outdoor managed animals have a pronounced circadian rhythm of active and resting periods, and time spent lying during daylight hours may be much lower than in housed environments.</td>

Respiratory infections are associated with coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, and/or audible breath sounds. for welfare assessment purposes, the presence of any of the symptoms is evidence of impaired respiration, due to either infectious disease or poor ventilation. Binary presence/absence scales are most commonly used to assess coughing and nasal discharge, although in these studies the incidence rates were too low to conduct reliability analyses.</td>

Stereotypy in sheep is infrequent, but the performance of oral (repetitive licking, chewing, and mouthing pen fixtures) and locomotor (rearing, butting, route-tracing, weaving) stereotypies have been reported in confined sheep. Sheep also show wool-pulling or biting when housed, particularly at high stocking density and when fed a diet with low roughage. Stereotypy does not appear to have been assessed on farm before as part of sheep welfare assessment, thus no reliability data are available. Unlike quantitative approaches that describe which behaviors are performed by animals, qualitative behavioral assesment (QBA) asks how behaviors are performed. With QBA information about body language and the way the animal interacts with the environment is assimilated and translated into qualitative descriptors such as “calm” or “agitated”. As the fixed lists for a species QBA can contain some 20 terms, involving both positive (e.g., calm, content) and negative terms (e.g., agitated, frustrated), QBA is not considered specific only to positive emotional states. Play in sheep appears to be largely restricted to young animals and is seen infrequently in adult animals. As the occurrence is so rare, it is likely that play will not be readily observed on farm and, thus, its utility as a welfare indicator in adult animals is doubtful.</td>

Due to differences in body conformation between beef and dairy cattle, two body condition scoring (BCS) systems were used for beef cattle and for dairy cows . Both scoring systems had similar technical descriptions. However, a visual scoring system was also utilised and allowed the conformation differences between beef and dairy breeds to be accounted for. Scores ranged from (1) Poor, (2) Moderate, (3) Good, (4) Fat to (5) Grossly fat. Body condition score was condensed into a binary variable for the regression analysis; score 1 and 2 were combined to form the category ‘Underweight,’ scores 3 to 5 were combined to form the category ‘Not underweight.’</td>

The size of the bruise at each of the seven anatomical sites was scored based on the diameter or longest length of bruise and assigned a score from 1 to 4—(1) 0 cm–2 cm, (2) 2 cm–8 cm, (3) 9 cm–16 cm, (4) more than 16 cm. If more than one bruise was present on a specific area, the maximum severity of the size were recorded. Bruise size was determined by holding up a clipboard with an integrated ruler to each bruise.

Distress calls are a catch-all response to a range of environmental stressors, and elicit food calling and brooding from hens. Further research is required to identify what triggers, and thus could alleviate, distress calling in broiler chicks. However, within the field of precision livestock farming, this work shows the potential for simple descriptors of the overall acoustic environment to be a novel, tractable and real-time ‘iceberg indicator’ of current and future welfare.</td>

Results showed that flock uniformity varied from 11% to 18% between flocks within the same hybrid, similar management standards, and similar slaughter age (day 29 to 32). Poorer uniformity was associated with increased first week mortality, increased total mortality,  less efficient growth) , reduced growth rate, and a reduced rejection rate at slaughter. The results show that flock uniformity varies across broiler flocks, and is associated with several production measures. Further research on a larger number of flocks is necessary to determine whether flock uniformity may represent a suitable iceberg indicator for welfare problems in commercial broiler flocks.</td>
