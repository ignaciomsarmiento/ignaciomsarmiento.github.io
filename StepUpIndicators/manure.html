Both databases revealed disparities in the number of available EFs between climatic zones (many more EFs developed for temperate zones than for tropical zones) but also between continents. Although there is a need for continued measurements in all regions of the world with adapted measurement protocols, this need is greatest in poorly represented regions such as Africa, Asia, and South America, where livestock production plays an important role but the number of available EFs is low.<br>During the MELS project, data will be analyzed to develop revised EFs and generate functional relationships between emissions and activity/ancillary variables, enabling a refinement of national inventories and better assessment of the<br>cost-effectiveness of a range of mitigation measures. The databases will be expanded over time by including new studies on GHG and NH3emissions across the world, allowing further refinement and disaggregation of EFs and improving our knowledge of key drivers along the manure management chain.</td>

                                <td>Methane (CH4) emissions from ten manure tanks were quantified using the tracer gas dispersion method over a full year, covering tanks that stored dairy cattle, pig and digested manure, and half of them had a tent cover. The highest annual average CH4 emissions were seen for pig manure storage tanks (1.56 ± 0.93 g m−3 h−1) followed by cattle manure tanks (0.63 ± 0.09 g m−3 h−1) and digested manure tanks (0.50 ± 0.02 g m−3 h−1). CH4 emissions tended to be higher during summer and autumn due the combination of more manure being stored in the tanks and relatively high atmospheric temperatures at these times of the year.<br>CH4 emissions tended to be higher from covered tanks; however, more studies should be done to explain if temperature is the reason for such a result. Finally, the variability of the quantified annual emissions reveals the complexity of emission dynamics, with several factors contributing to these variations. Delving into the tank&#x27;s microbiology could complement and help understand emission variability.</td>

                                <td>Under the various challenges to meet increasing population and crop demands for livestock products under conditions of climate change and issues related to environmental pollution, it is crucial to be able to quantify and compare GHGs and NH3 emissions from different livestock categories during the manure storage phase to develop effective mitigation strategies. Therefore, this study comprehensively estimated GHGs and NH3 emissions from conventional solid dairy cattle and swine manure storage based on field measurements. Results showed that GHGs emissions from swine manure were similar to that from dairy cattle manure, but NH3 emissions of the former were higher overall. This could be attributed to the different physicochemical characteristics of manure and may also be associated with the microbiological, chemical, and physical processes that produce gas during the storage phase. As it pertains to GHGs emissions, CO2 emissions from swine manure accounted for 89.3% of total GHGs emissions, which was the largest overall gas source. By contrast, CH4 and CO2 were the two largest gas sources from dairy cattle manure, representing 49.3% and 49.6%, respectively. Along with the increasing predicted demand for milk and meat in the future, a correspondingly large amount of manure will be excreted by dairy cattle and swine, which will result in much higher GHGs and NH3 emissions unless effective mitigation strategies are taken.<br>Our results not only provide insight into the simultaneous evaluation of GHGs and NH3 emissions from the manure of swine and dairy cattle, but they also offer useful information for the simultaneous mitigation of GHGs and NH3 emissions from two inherently different livestock species when strategies are to be adopted in making relevant mitigation policies. Controlling the increase in the population of dairy cattle and swine is regarded as the most direct and effective strategy to mitigate GHGs and NH3 emissions; however, this strategy is somewhat unrealistic and challenging (Zhuang et al., 2019a).<br>The question of how to simultaneously mitigate GHGs and NH3 emissions from swine and dairy cattle manure has drawn increasing attention in China in recent years (Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2017). CO2 emissions have become the largest gas source from swine manure, while CH4 and CO2 emissions are the two largest gas sources that derive from dairy cattle manure. However, to avoid trade-offs between different gases emissions, we should comprehensively evaluate the effects of mitigation strategies on overall gas emissions rather than a single gas (Wang et al., 2017). In this context, some potential mitigation strategies have been proposed, such as applying selective additives (e.g., biochar, alum, and zeolite) (Lim et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019) or focusing on aeration (Chowdhury et al., 2014; Zeng et al., 2017), pile turning (Li et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2018), or coverage strategies (Wang et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2018) to mitigate solid manure gases emissions. For instance, Zhang et al. (2019) reported that swine manure composting applying biochar reduced total N2O and NH3 emissions by 39.1% compared to conventional solid swine manure practices, while Lim et al. (2017) found that composting with phosphogypsum and zeolite significantly decreased NH3 and CH4 emissions by 30% and 97.0%, respectively. In addition, manure coverage practices may be another useful mitigation solution to reduce GHGs and NH3 emissions. Previous studies have shown that coverage strategies can reduce NH3 emissions from swine manure by 40–98% and CH4 emissions by 38–86%, respectively, which depend on the coverage management practices used, such as the cover material and the cover method (Sommer et al., 2000; Portejoie et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2015). However, selecting inappropriate cover material and cover methods could also increase GHGs and NH3 emissions from manure (Amon et al., 2006). Based on the above analysis, we found that the mitigation effect on GHGs and NH3 emissions varied among these different mitigation strategies. Thus, although the combination and optimization of the various mitigation strategies may be effective, they warrant further research. Information such as that provided in this study is crucial for devising relevant mitigation policies for livestock manure on a national scale into the future.<br>Although we systemically analyzed and compared GHGs and NH3 emissions of solid stored manure from dairy cattle and swine over the short-term, we did not investigate long-term gas emissions from manure in this study, which could to a certain extent lead to uncertainty in the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies discussed. Therefore, continuous long-term field observations of GHGs and NH3 emissions from the manure of various livestock animals should be carried out in the future, which will allow us to better understand seasonal and interannual variation in gases emissions and their associated influencing factors, while also helping to develop much more effective mitigation strategies.</td>

                                <td>We analysed the effects of dairy manure storage period on the dynamics of CH4 and N2O emissions at smallholder dairy farms. Manure composition changed during storage, including an increase in TS in all manure treatments except for MS-DF1. Conversely, the N, N-NH3, and C-organic content decreased in all treatments across the eight-week storage period. The findings align with our hypothesis in which we found that there was a significant interaction between manure types and storage periods, showing the importance of carefully selecting appropriate ones at each farm to effectively reduce N2O and CH4 emissions. Different manure management practices such as FP-DF1 and the lowest in IP-DF1 are associated with lower cumulative N2O and CH4 emissions respectively. In our study, N2O fluxes were formed at the start, peaked at the middle, and decreased gradually towards the end of the storage period. In contrast, CH4 peaked at the start and levelled off towards the end of the storage. The change in manure composition and the diet of the animals are two important factors affecting the N2O and CH4 emissions of manure. Based on our study, we suggest three improvement options to reduce GHG emissions from manure management. First, reducing moisture content which could avoid the loss of CH4 but potentially stimulate N2O. Second, shortening the storage period which can prevent the loss of valuable nutrients and minimize both CH4 and N2O emissions during storage, and this represent the most preferable option, particularly for smallholder dairy farms with limited storage capacity. Third, changing diet to increase feed efficiency which can reduce CH4, and minimize the N in faces which subsequently reduces N2O.</td>

                                <td>Literature data shows that slurry separation under some circumstances reduces NH3 loss after field application, but there are very few measurements giving absolute emission factors after field application of the liquid fraction and corresponding raw slurry.<br>Emission estimates modelled with the ALFAM2 model were used to explore potential effects of separation on NH3 loss, and to assess whether uncertainty in separation performance prevents estimation of the effect of separation on NH3 loss. The results showed an effect on NH3 emission for cattle slurry and digestate when the liquid fraction or raw slurry was surface applied by trailing hose or trailing shoe, even when considering the uncertainty in separation performance. The highest emission reductions were obtained with incorporation of the solid fraction after field application. For separation of pig slurry, or application of any of the slurry types by open slot injection, overall NH3 emission after separation was lower or equal to the reference scenario with incorporation of the solid fraction 4 h after application. Without incorporation of the solid fraction, overall emission was in some cases larger than the reference for pig slurry and application by open slot injection.<br>Field emission accounted for 75–95% of the total (storage and field) emission, therefore its estimation is important. The present study used the ALFAM2 model for emission predictions after field application as it is believed to be the best available tool as literature data was insufficient.<br>The findings of the study can help farmers and policy makers to choose the most applicable low-emission technology, e.g., according to this study separation should only be considered as an NH3 reducing technology for surface applied digestate and cattle slurry, whereas other technologies must be considered if the goal is to reduce emissions after application of pig slurry.</td>
