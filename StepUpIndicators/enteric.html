The intercontinental database covered Europe (EU), the United States (US), and Australia (AU).</td>

                                <td>Within model categories, an intercontinental model with the most available independent variables performed best with root mean square prediction error (RMSPE) as a percentage of mean observed value of 16.6%, 14.7%, and 19.8% for intercontinental, EU, and United States regions, respectively. Less complex models requiring only DMI had predictive ability comparable to complex<br>models. Enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity prediction models developed on an intercontinental basis had similar performance across regions, however, intercepts<br>and slopes were different with implications for prediction. Revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are required to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories. In conclusion, information on DMI is required for good prediction, and other factors such as dietary neutral detergent fiber (NDF) concentration, improve the prediction. For enteric CH4 yield and intensity prediction, information on milk yield and composition is required for better estimation.</td>
                                <td>In summary, our analysis based on a relatively large dataset from the GLOBAL NETWORK project, indicated that the ability to predict<br>enteric CH4 production increases with increasing model complexity. As observed previously, DMI is the key factor for enteric CH4 production<br>prediction. Although complex models that use DMI, NDF, EE, MF, and BW had the best performance for predicting CH4 production, models requiring only DMI or DMI + NDF had the second<br>best predictive ability and offer an alternative to complex models. Milk production and composition variables are key factors to predict CH4 yield, whereas milk composition and animal variables are key<br>factors to predict CH4 intensity. Model evaluation specific to individual regions compared with that of intercontinental based models suggests that enteric CH4 production, yield, and intensity can be accurately predicted from both intercontinental models and regionalspecific models with similar performance. Although prediction performance was similar, intercepts and slopes of variables in optimal prediction equations developed on intercontinental basis differed from those developed on regional basis. Therefore, revised CH4 emission conversion factors for specific regions are preferred to improve CH4 production estimates in national inventories.</td>

These uncertainties arise from several factors, including:<br>• Variability in animal inventories<br>• Differences in feed dry matter intake (DMI)<br>• Ingredient and chemical composition of diets<br>• Variations in CH₄ emission factors<br>Additionally, measuring enteric CH₄ emissions is complex, with commonly used techniques including:<br>1. Respiration chambers<br>2. Sulfur hexafluoride (SF₆) tracer technique<br>3. Automated head-chamber system (GreenFeed®)<br>Although these methods have been widely applied across various studies, comparisons between techniques have yielded inconsistent results. As a result, predictive models have been developed to estimate enteric CH₄ emissions, particularly for national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventories. Empirical (statistical) models are often preferred over mechanistic process-based models, due to their ease of use and broad applicability.<br>However, existing empirical CH₄ prediction models suffer from:<br>• Limited geographical scope<br>• Restricted observations<br>• Constraints in statistical modelling techniques<br>To enhance prediction accuracy, robust datasets must be collaboratively assembled by scientists worldwide. These datasets should incorporate diverse diets and production systems, spanning different regions and global contexts</td>

                                <td>There are large uncertainties in livestock CH4 national and global inventories; sources of uncertainties in enteric CH4 emission include animal inventories, feed DMI, ingredient and chemical composition of the diet, and CH4 emission factors. There is also significant uncertainty associated with enteric CH4 measurements. Widely used measurement techniques are respiration chambers, the SF6 tracer technique, and the GreenFeed system. All 3 methods need to be correctly and appropriately used to generate reliable and accurate data and valid tests of effects of diets and other treatments on enteric CH4 emission or animal variation in CH4 emission rates; some uncertainty remains as direct comparisons of techniques have shown inconsistent results. We emphasize that each of these techniques can have low accuracy and precision or produce misleading results if not properly implemented. Detailed guidelines for these techniques have been published and should be followed rigorously by researchers. Enteric CH4 prediction models are based on various animal or feed characteristic inputs but are dominated by DMI in one form or another. Therefore, accurate prediction of DMI is of pivotal importance for accurate prediction of livestock CH4 emissions. It is recommended that simplified enteric CH4 prediction models based on DMI alone or DMI and limited feed- or animal-related inputs be developed and used for inventory purposes, where sufficient details or accuracy on dietary inputs are lacking. Broadly applicable and robust prediction models must be developed from large data sets generated through collaboration of scientists worldwide. To achieve high prediction accuracy, these data sets should encompass a wide range of diets and production systems within regions and globally. The uncertainty in enteric CH4 prediction can be reduced by developing region-specific Ym values. Similarly, the uncertainty in DMI estimation can be decreased by using DMI prediction equations that are region-specific instead of the GEI approach of IPCC Tier 2.</td>

                                <td>This study provides site-level atmospheric methane observations during the course of one year, at three selected hotspots, representing 28 % of Cyprus national methane emissions. It sheds light on the discrepancies between bottom-up and top-down estimation approaches. After extrapolation, our calculated top-down estimates of methane waste and livestock emissions for Cyprus were 129 % and 40 % larger than the reported values in the bottom-up national inventory. Due to the ambient meteorological conditions of the subtropical climate, we expect only small seasonal changes in biogenic methane emissions from landfills and cattle farms.For livestock, this study provides a method to quantify enteric methane emissions from cattle bridging the site scale to the national scale, whereas previous studies focused essentially on animal- or farm-scale (Storm et al., 2012; Golston et al., 2020; Vinkovi´c et al., 2022). Our study assumed that the dairy and non-dairy cattle distribution at the surveyed area is representative of the national-level dairy and non-dairy cattle population distribution, which may have a significant impact on national estimates of enteric CH4 emissions from livestock. Our study also highlights closed landfills may be a significant, underestimated CH4 emission source, even if active landfills are properly accounted for. Therefore, to achieve efficient mitigation of CH4 emissions, closed landfills should be monitored regularly and targeted by mitigation approaches. Additional measurements would be required to cover more emission source categories and extend our understanding of local to national methane emissions in Cyprus. Furthermore, different observation platforms and calculation methods could complement top-down estimates of this study and help to move towards a top-down vs. bottom-up reconciliation (Guha et al., 2020). For example, aircraft mass balance estimates for methane have been found to be 1.4–2.8 times higher than a city inventory (Lamb et al., 2016). Our findings indicate that the bottom-up methane emissions from solid waste disposal are clearly underestimated by a factor of 2.3 for Cyprus. The development of an inventory including more site-specific and more contemporary emission factors is equally vital in reconciling top-down/bottom-up approaches, as hinted by Lyon et al. (2015) and Amini et al. (2022). This survey method can be applied for other regions or small-surface countries aiming to assess the methane emission structure independently from inventories and support policymakers in designing and implementing efficient mitigation action. The use of commercially available sensors, car platforms and open-source modeling ensure easy reproduction. Indeed, the method presented here is suitable for countries where it is possible to directly estimate a significant and representative amount of the total emissions of major emitting sectors. In order to obtain comparable data, it is necessary to select the largest and most representative emission sources and areas. Actually, with only slightly more resources it would be feasible to monitor almost 100 % of Cyprus methane emissions and therefore make more robust top-down estimates but also test the extrapolation hypotheses for different fractions of partial monitoring. This approach is suitable for methane in livestock and waste sectors, with point sources and limited seasonal variability. The method would be easily applied to upstream and mid-stream fossil fuel methane emissions but would be more challenging in cases with more diffuse leaks of natural gas distribution networks. The method covers a large fraction of global emissions and is promising for many developing countries which have limited resources to develop atmospheric networks or sophisticated inventories.</td>

                                <td>The effectiveness of forage-related CH4 mitigation strategies, including feeding grass (herbage or silage) with increased levels of digestibility or replacing different forage types with corn silage, differs across dairy cattle, beef cattle, and sheep. These strategies are most effective for dairy cattle, are effective to some extent for beef cattle, but have no or minor effects in sheep. This is most likely due to differences in feed intake level and rumen physiology between the different types of ruminants. In general, the effectiveness of other dietary CH4 mitigation strategies, including increased concentrate feeding and the use of feed additives (e.g., nitrate), appears to be similar for dairy cattle, beef cattle, and sheep. This illustrates that the modes of action of these strategies are independent of differences in feed intake, rumen physiology, and fermentation characteristics across ruminant types. Therefore, we conclude that if the mode of action of a dietary CH4 mitigation strategy is directly associated with methanogenesis-related fermentation pathways, the strategy is more likely to have a similar effect across different types of ruminants. If the mode of action of a dietary CH4 mitigation strategy is related to ruminant-specific factors such as feed intake or rumen physiology, the effectiveness of the strategy is more likely to differ between ruminant types. Subsequently, reductions in CH4 emission obtained in one type of ruminant may not apply to other ruminant types, as observed in the present study.</td>

                                <td>Dry matter intake is the key variable for predicting enteric CH4<br>production in sheep. However, increasing the model complexity by<br>including BW, OMD or rumen propionate proportion improved<br>prediction performances for the universal equations, whereas diet<br>composition had a minor impact. Prediction performance was increased<br>through developing age-specific models to accommodate the physiological<br>and dietary differences. For adult sheep (&gt;1-year-old), models<br>should include DMI alone or in combination with propionate molar<br>proportion as the key variables. On the contrary, for young sheep (&lt;1-<br>year-old), the universal models can be applied if DMI and BW are<br>included as key variables. Our findings indicate that appropriate universal<br>equations accurately predict CH4 production across different diets<br>and climatic conditions without compromising prediction performance.<br>The equations developed in the present study commonly had lower<br>prediction errors than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Equations for<br>CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively<br>and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. These<br>findings suggest that the proposed universal equations, in combination<br>with the age-specific equations represent an opportunity to improve<br>ovine CH4 production estimates in national or global inventories and for<br>research purposes.</td>

For mitigation strategies based on lowering NDF or improving dOM, the same model (RSR = 0.48 to 0.60) and the model using DMI and neutral- and acid-detergent fiber intakes (RSR = 0.53) had the smallest RSR, respectively. For diets with high starch (STA), the model based on nitrogen, ADF and STA intake presented the smallest RSR (0.84). For beef cattle, all evaluated models performed moderately compared with the models of dairy cattle. The smallest RSR (0.83) was obtained using variables of energy intake, BW, forage content and dietary fat, and also for the high-EE and the low-NDF diets (RSR = 0.84 to 0.86). The IPCC Tier 2 models performed better when dietary STA, dOM or dNDF were high. For sheep and goats, the smallest RSR was observed from a model for sheep based on dGE intake (RSR = 0.61). Both IPCC models had low predictive ability when dietary EE, NDF, dOM and dNDF varied (RSR = 0.57 to 1.31 in dairy, and 0.65 to 1.24 in beef cattle).</td>
