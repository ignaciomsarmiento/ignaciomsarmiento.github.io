This aim was achieved by collecting topsoil samples (0–20 cm) from four long-term fertilization practices, i.e., unfertilized, synthetic supplemental (+s), cattle farmyard manure  (+m, similar nutrient amount to +s), and synthetic fertilizer with farmyard manure (+s +m, the highest nutrient  amount). The soil samples were incubated for 33 days with and without 13C glucose addition, and a CO2 isotope analyzer combined with a modeling approach was used to establish a real-time method to monitor CO2 and 13CO2 production rates during the incubation period</td>
                                <td>high benefits of organic manure in increasing SOC  and TN content. These increases were greater than the impact induced  by synthetic fertilizers (i.e., no effect on SOC and 13 % increase in TN).  Unlike synthetic fertilizer, manure applications can improve soil physical and chemical properties, i.e., maintaining neutral pH, having a  higher water holding capacity and lower bulk density, and favoring  microbial growth and microbial-driven processes compared to synthetic  fertilizers.  This reflects that  manure application could improve soil organic matter quantity and  quality, and soil fertility, compared to synthetic fertilizer under long_x0002_term continual application. The manure potential for SOC sequestration was  remarkable when the farmyard manure was applied in combination with  synthetic fertilizer (i.e., +s +m). Such findings are consistent with many  previous studies (Ding et al., 2014; Iqbal et al., 2020; Wu, 2019) and  highlight the importance of managing farmyard manure application to  increase manure-derived C in spite of increasing SOC mineralization for  optimizing C sequestration efficiency in agricultural systems.</td>

The ideal proportion of legumes in meadows and pastures is still a matter of debate. The dry matter intake increases with legume content, and milk yield can increase until legume coverage reaches 50–60% [10,18,49,50] but there are possible downsides to such high values. The advantages, like high nutritive values and increased intake, can be counteracted by disadvantages like poor ensiling performance [51], potential N leaching [50,52], and a higher bloat risk. The achieved 20 to 30% legume coverage is a good value to maximize advantages and avoid disadvantages. All farmers managed their fields independently and without further instructions, yet all of them reduced the amount of mineral N fertiliser by 10 to 15% in the later study years since they saw a positive influence of the legumes and were, therefore, able to reduce costs.</td>

The P uptake of amaranth increased considerably on both soils compared to the control when dairy slurry (sand +56%, loam +34%) or codigested slurry (sand +62%, loam +64%) was applied.  P uptake in both slurry treatments was as high as in the mineral-P treatment.   Irrespective of crop species and soil type, N uptake was highest in the treatments in which mineral N was supplied (NK, NPK) and was reduced by about 50% in the organic-fertilizer treatments. Using the codigested slurry considerably increased N uptake compared to the dairy slurry.  Irrespective of crop species or soil, the soil organic matter content (SOM) was up to 10% higher in the organic-fertilizer treatments than in the mineral-fertilizer treatments.</td>

The pasture was divided into two paddocks that differed in the stocking density of grazing animals (Angus beef cows). The paddock identified as moderate-grazing grassland included continuous grazing with moderate stocking density (0.76 LU ha−1), while the paddock identified as heavy-grazing grassland included continuous grazing with high stocking density (1.26 LU ha−1).</td>
                                <td>Despite increases in key nutrients and pH, heavy grazing increases soil compaction, structural deterioration, soil erosion and nutrient losses compared with moderate grazing and no grazing. This study demonstrates that a moderate-grazing system does not cause severe soil erosion and does not reduce land productivity. In conclusion, switching to different grazing management and adopting environmental protection measures on heavily grazed areas could ensure grassland sustainability by reducing soil and nutrient losses and increasing vegetation cover, biomass production, and the herbage nutritional value.</td>

On clay soils where the botanical composition of grasslands contain &gt; 70% of desirable grasses, the presumed yield benefit of grassland renewal (sowing of the most recently developed grass varieties) is offset by a loss of soil quality (SOM and N-total). Accordingly, the current practice of grassland renewal within a relatively short time-span (every ten years) without considering the botanical composition, is counter-productive and not sustainable. Farm management should focus on minimizing the need for renewal by good grassland management, e.g., maintaining desirable grasses by grazing, ample fertilization, irrigation and preventing and ameliorating soil compaction</td>
